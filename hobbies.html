                <h3>COOKING AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD</h3>
                <p>
                    I love cooking Italian food, using recipes passed down from generation to generation.  It's fun teaching my kids to cook and it's a great
                    way to detached from iPads and smartphones.  My favorite dishes are pasta fagioli (pasta fasool), zuppa di pesce, and authentic meatballs
                    made with a combination of veal, pork, and beef.

            <h3>HOME REMODELING</h3>
            
            <p>
                I love tackling new remodeling projects.  My specialty is designing kitchens. I usually use Ikea kitchens because you can't beat the quality at the 
                sub $8,000 price range.  The most fun is mixing and matching the countertops and backsplashes. I've done a range of countertops ranging from concrete 
                to butcher block to slate tile set over cement board.  I also love refinishing wood floors, which brings to life 100 year old floors and saving landfill 
                space.  I use a heavy floor sander and finish with tung oil, leaving a natural finish that's not plasticky like polyurethane.         </p>

            <h3>TRAVELING</h3>

            <P> I love to travel to new places and meet interest folks.  I lived in Norway for six months on a work project, met my wife in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
                and spent a week in Havana, Cuba doing absolutely nothing.  I live traveling to offbeat locations like Serbia and Bratislava.
