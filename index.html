                <h3>MY INTEREST IN CODING, DATA SCIENCE, AND CLOUD COMPUTING</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm excited about beginning a career in programming and / or data science.  I've always love learning languages, which includes translating 
                    Plato's Apology and St John Gospel from Greek in English or speaking an ancient Neopolitan dialect in Italy which my family in Italy laughed at.  Right how is 
                    a great time to upskill as the economy is evolving more rapidly than ever.  Whether this is preparing to inevitable AI developments to the huge leaps in
                    machine learning, or working with companies and colleagues to harness the overwhelming amount of data they have which is far to often underutilized.
                    I'm also excited to pursue a career that offers flexbility and allows me to have more fun. In addition to taking this program at Coding Temple, I'm 
                    preparing to take (and hopefully pass) the Amazon Web Services Solutions Architect Associate Exam.

                <h3>REAL ESTATE AND SHORT TERM RENTALS</h3>
                <p>Real estate has always been a passion for me and I thoroughly enjoy remodeling houses.  Not only from the standpoint of designing, but I also like to get my 
                    hands dirty doing much of the renovation work myself, and with the help of my wife Roselaine.  My specialties include kitchen installations, usually IKEA, and 
                    wordworking ranging from floor refinishing, to custom door barn door construction, to installation of doors and windows.  <br>
                    It's fun preserving older houses on the verge of being torn down, and bringing new life to it by upgrading the guts and mechanical aspects of the home while 
                    preserving the original charm that cannot be replaced by cookie cutter modern construction.  I always think about all the families who have lived in these 
                    places before and sometimes even find family heirlooms behind sheetrock or buried in a closet.  <br>
                    My wife and I host a dozen short-term rentals on popular platforms such as AirBnB and VRBO, but hope to leverage newly gained HTML / CSS experience to
                    customer websites to tap undeveloped markets and reach different audiences.  Hosting comes with the good and the bad, but it's really enjoyable to meet new 
                    people and share your passion with them.
